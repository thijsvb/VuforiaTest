# VuforiaTest
Testing out different features of [Vuforia](http://vuforia.com) in [Unity](http://unity3d.com)

### Tests
I'll be trying out:

* a single image target :white_check_mark:
* a cuboid target :white_check_mark:
* a cylindrical target :white_check_mark:
* a 3d object target :white_check_mark:
* using multiple targets of all types in a single database :white_check_mark:

3d objects have to be scanned with Vuforia's app, more info [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/Vuforia-Object-Scanner-Users-Guide) and [here](https://library.vuforia.com/articles/Training/Object-Recognition).

### Cylinder 
The cylinder can also be a (truncated cone)

### 3D Object
Inside Unity the 3d object is seen as another database, so you'll have to activate it separately.
